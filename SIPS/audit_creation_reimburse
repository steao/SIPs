## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Reimburse contract creation and audit expenses (total 9,500 USDC and Ξ2.328)

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP reimburses the addresses that paid for vital SharedStake services.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

With the developer allocation timelock in force, this SIP’s goal is to continue to incentivize growth through decentralization. 

## Specification

The Treasury will pay out the equivalent of 9,700 USDC for the contract audit with CertiK and 2.328 ether for initial deployment of SharedStake contracts to identified addresses.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Once this SIP is approved, the Treasury will reimburse identified addresses up to a maximum of the equivalent of 9,700 USDC and 2.328 ether.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Administrative expenses such as audit and contract creation should be covered by the SGT DAO Treasury, however the Treasury was not yet established when certain fees were due. The SharedStake devs have demonstrated their intention to build for the SGT community and this community decision reciprocates their trust.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces SharedStake Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
